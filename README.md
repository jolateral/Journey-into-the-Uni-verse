# Journey into the Uni-verse

## Description
Writing applications to post-secondary is daunting; there are so many deadlines and tasks to keep track of, those interview questions can seem like a big mysetery, and not to mention the amount of programs to choose from that would make one's head spin.

The point is that university applications are a lot, and they can be even more overwhelming for first-generation students, who are the first in their families to attend or complete a post-seocndary degree, or aren't familiar with the Canadian education system.

_Journey into the Uni-verse_ aims to support incoming students that have to tackle university applications on their own. It strives to be a helping hand, and to remind them they are not alone, and that they can do it.
